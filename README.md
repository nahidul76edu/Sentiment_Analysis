# Sentiment_Analysis

Project Overview:
This project is structured into three sequential notebooks that guide you through the various phases of model development, from initial data preparation to the implementation of advanced models. Each notebook is designed to perform specific tasks, ensuring clarity and modular development.

Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Notebook: data-cleaning-and-preprocessing.ipynb

Step 2: Handling Imbalanced Datasets, Feature Extraction (FE), and implement Machine learning (ML) models.
Notebook: handling-imbalanced-datasets-fe-ml.ipynb

Step 3: Proposed Model Development
Notebook: proposed-distilrobilstmfuse-model.ipynb

How to Run the Notebooks:
Start at Step 1: Begin with the first notebook to clean and preprocess your data. This foundation is critical for successful model outcomes.

Proceed to Step 2: Once the data is ready, load the saved csv file achieved from Step 1, move on to the second notebook to handle data imbalance and extract features. This step also involves preliminary ML model testing.

Complete with Step 3: With the data fully prepared and initial models tested, implement the proposed model in the third notebook.
